This application was generated using http://start.vertx.io and I will keep asciidoc, in markdown extension detriment, to honor Vertx starter which actually helps setting up the gradle plugins and tasks.

== Building

To package your application:
```
./gradlew clean assemble
```

To run your application:
```
./gradlew clean run
```
== Vertx cli
Vertx has a cli called https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-shell/java/[vertx shell] which I found quite interesting. It makes it easy to form a clustered application of Vertx Microservices with a shared service bus, quite fancy. You can use it to start 5 instances of the WebSocket client.
```
vertx run src/main/java/com/nrelic/MainVerticle.java --instances 5
```

== WsClient Design
Straight forward. Create a basic HTTP client. Request WebSocket connection.
[source,java]
-----------------
HttpClient client = vertx.createHttpClient(options);
// socket message sender
client.webSocket("/", sock -> {
    if (sock.succeeded()) {
        System.out.println("Connected socket");
        WebSocket socket = sock.result();
        ...
-----------------
=== Infinite loop in Vertx
Vertx is not intended to execute blocking code. It always expects an event as input. Since the Vertx Periodic task can only be scheduled in milliseconds magnitudes and as we want to be in nanoseconds magnitudes, we have to find a workaround.
Executing an infinite loop in Vertx requires us to encapsulate the code as a blocking piece of code. Notice that this is intended to be a massive load generator. As we already know that the server will pause the socket for backpressure, from the client-side perspective the socket writing queue will also get eventually full. In a real case scenario, a circuit-breaker will be recommended.
[source,java]
-----------------
// As there is no event but an infinite loop we have to cheat vertX with a blocking piece of code.
vertx.executeBlocking(promise -> {
  while (true) {
    // Only send if the queue is not full.
    if (!socket.writeQueueFull()) {
      Future.<String>future(f -> // Generate ramdom 9 digits with left pad
        f.complete(String.format("%09d", VertxContextPRNG.current(vertx).nextInt(1000000000)))
      ).onComplete(number -> socket.writeTextMessage(number.result()));
    }
-----------------
Vertx will warn you about Threads that get blocked for more than 2s. executeBlocking is the exception, it will start warning after 50s. And it will as the code is running an infinite loop.

== What we expect
I will describe how I've been testing the service, but you can do it your way. Actually while developing I have been using JetBrains IntelliJ.

Start the server
```
$ java -jar Server/build/libs/Server-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar
File numbers.log deleted
File Created
Server is now listening on port 4000
Received 0 unique numbers, 0 duplicates. Unique Total: 0 Connections: 0

```
Start the Clients
```
$ vertx run .\src\main\java\com\nrelic\MainVerticle.java --instances 5
SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder".
SLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementation

Don't worry about the SLF4J errors as is vertx cli cluster matters that don't bother us.

Come back to the server console
```

BackPressure

```
I print each time a Backpressure event occurs. It's telling the client to hold on.

What if there is no write to file? Just delete that piece of code:

image:../assets/No-file.png[alt="remove file.write call"]

Over a million and a half...

As expected, even if there could be a bunch of performance tunnings, writing to the file is the slowest task and so is the throughput of the *microservice*.
